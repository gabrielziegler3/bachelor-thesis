The underlying optimization problem corresponds to ﬁnding the vector that solves the minimization while explaining the measurements, and IRLS allows to easily control the used value of , with effect on the number of required measurements. In this paper, we propose a weighting strategy in the reconstruction method based on IRLS in order to add prior information on the support of the sparse domain. Our simulation results show that the use of prior knowledge about positions of at least some of the nonzero coefﬁcients in the sparse domain leads to a reduction in the number of linear measurements required for unambiguous reconstruction. This reduction occurs for all values of , so that a further reduction can be achieved by decreasing and using prior information. The proposed weighting scheme also reduces the computational complexity with respect to the IRLS with no prior information, both in terms of number of iterations and computation time.},

	abstract = {Undersampled magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction is typically an ill-posed linear inverse task. The time and resource intensive computations require trade offs between accuracy and speed. In addition, state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS) analytics are not cognizant of the image diagnostic quality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CS framework that uses generative adversarial networks (GAN) to model the (low-dimensional) manifold of high-quality MR images. Leveraging a mixture of least-squares (LS) GANs and pixel-wise 1/ 2 cost, a deep residual network with skip connections is trained as the generator that learns to remove the aliasing artifacts by projecting onto the image manifold. The LSGAN learns the texture details, while the 1/ 2 cost suppresses high-frequency noise. A discriminator network, which is a multilayer convolutional neural network (CNN), plays the role of a perceptual cost that is then jointly trained based on high quality MR images to score the quality of retrieved images. In the operational phase, an initial aliased estimate (e.g., simply obtained by zero-ﬁlling) is propagated into the trained generator to output the desired reconstruction. This demands very low computational overhead. Extensive evaluations are performed on a large contrast-enhanced MR dataset of pediatric patients. Images rated by expert radiologists corroborate that GANCS retrieves higher quality images with improved ﬁne texture details compared with conventional Wavelet-based and dictionary-learning based CS schemes as well as with deeplearning based schemes using pixel-wise training. In addition, it offers reconstruction times of under a few milliseconds, which is two orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art CS-MRI schemes.},

	abstract = {In recent years, a variety of segmentation methods have been proposed for automatic delineation of the fetal and neonatal brain MRI. These methods aim to deﬁne regions of interest of diﬀerent granularity: brain, tissue types or more localised structures. Diﬀerent methodologies have been applied for this segmentation task and can be classiﬁed into unsupervised, parametric, classiﬁcation, atlas fusion and deformable models. Brain atlases are commonly utilised as training data in the segmentation process. Challenges relating to the image acquisition, the rapid brain development as well as the limited availability of imaging data however hinder this segmentation task. In this paper, we review methods adopted for the perinatal brain and categorise them according to the target population, structures segmented and methodology. We outline diﬀerent methods proposed in the literature and discuss their major contributions. Diﬀerent approaches for the evaluation of the segmentation accuracy and benchmarks used for the segmentation quality are presented. We conclude this review with a discussion on shortcomings in the perinatal domain and possible future directions.},

A little more than ﬁfty years of studying problems of this kind have shown that a great number of problems from various branches of classical mathematics (computational algebra, differential and integral equations, partial differential equations, functional analysis) can be classiﬁed as inverse or ill-posed, and they are among the most complicated ones (since they are unstable and usually nonlinear). At the same time, inverse and ill-posed problems began to be studied and applied systematically in physics, geophysics, medicine, astronomy, and all other areas of knowledge where mathematical methods are used. The reason is that solutions to inverse problems describe important properties of media under study, such as density and velocity of wave propagation, elasticity parameters, conductivity, dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability, and properties and location of inhomogeneities in inaccessible areas, etc.},

Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator.

	abstract = {In recent years, a variety of segmentation methods have been proposed for automatic delineation of the fetal and neonatal brain MRI. These methods aim to deﬁne regions of interest of diﬀerent granularity: brain, tissue types or more localised structures. Diﬀerent methodologies have been applied for this segmentation task and can be classiﬁed into unsupervised, parametric, classiﬁcation, atlas fusion and deformable models. Brain atlases are commonly utilised as training data in the segmentation process. Challenges relating to the image acquisition, the rapid brain development as well as the limited availability of imaging data however hinder this segmentation task. In this paper, we review methods adopted for the perinatal brain and categorise them according to the target population, structures segmented and methodology. We outline diﬀerent methods proposed in the literature and discuss their major contributions. Diﬀerent approaches for the evaluation of the segmentation accuracy and benchmarks used for the segmentation quality are presented. We conclude this review with a discussion on shortcomings in the perinatal domain and possible future directions.},

A little more than ﬁfty years of studying problems of this kind have shown that a great number of problems from various branches of classical mathematics (computational algebra, differential and integral equations, partial differential equations, functional analysis) can be classiﬁed as inverse or ill-posed, and they are among the most complicated ones (since they are unstable and usually nonlinear). At the same time, inverse and ill-posed problems began to be studied and applied systematically in physics, geophysics, medicine, astronomy, and all other areas of knowledge where mathematical methods are used. The reason is that solutions to inverse problems describe important properties of media under study, such as density and velocity of wave propagation, elasticity parameters, conductivity, dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability, and properties and location of inhomogeneities in inaccessible areas, etc.},

We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

The underlying optimization problem corresponds to ﬁnding the vector that solves the minimization while explaining the measurements, and IRLS allows to easily control the used value of , with effect on the number of required measurements. In this paper, we propose a weighting strategy in the reconstruction method based on IRLS in order to add prior information on the support of the sparse domain. Our simulation results show that the use of prior knowledge about positions of at least some of the nonzero coefﬁcients in the sparse domain leads to a reduction in the number of linear measurements required for unambiguous reconstruction. This reduction occurs for all values of , so that a further reduction can be achieved by decreasing and using prior information. The proposed weighting scheme also reduces the computational complexity with respect to the IRLS with no prior information, both in terms of number of iterations and computation time.},

Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized.

	abstract = {In recent years, a variety of segmentation methods have been proposed for automatic delineation of the fetal and neonatal brain MRI. These methods aim to deﬁne regions of interest of diﬀerent granularity: brain, tissue types or more localised structures. Diﬀerent methodologies have been applied for this segmentation task and can be classiﬁed into unsupervised, parametric, classiﬁcation, atlas fusion and deformable models. Brain atlases are commonly utilised as training data in the segmentation process. Challenges relating to the image acquisition, the rapid brain development as well as the limited availability of imaging data however hinder this segmentation task. In this paper, we review methods adopted for the perinatal brain and categorise them according to the target population, structures segmented and methodology. We outline diﬀerent methods proposed in the literature and discuss their major contributions. Diﬀerent approaches for the evaluation of the segmentation accuracy and benchmarks used for the segmentation quality are presented. We conclude this review with a discussion on shortcomings in the perinatal domain and possible future directions.},

	abstract = {The terms “inverse problems” and “ill-posed problems” have been steadily and surely gaining popularity in modern science since the middle of the 20th century. A little more than ﬁfty years of studying problems of this kind have shown that a great number of problems from various branches of classical mathematics (computational algebra, differential and integral equations, partial differential equations, functional analysis) can be classiﬁed as inverse or ill-posed, and they are among the most complicated ones (since they are unstable and usually nonlinear). At the same time, inverse and ill-posed problems began to be studied and applied systematically in physics, geophysics, medicine, astronomy, and all other areas of knowledge where mathematical methods are used. The reason is that solutions to inverse problems describe important properties of media under study, such as density and velocity of wave propagation, elasticity parameters, conductivity, dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability, and properties and location of inhomogeneities in inaccessible areas, etc.},

	abstract = {In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},
