	abstract = {Iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) algorithms have been successfully used in compressive sensing to reconstruct sparse signals from incomplete linear measurements taken in nonsparse domains. The underlying optimization problem corresponds to ﬁnding the vector that solves the minimization while explaining the measurements, and IRLS allows to easily control the used value of , with effect on the number of required measurements. In this paper, we propose a weighting strategy in the reconstruction method based on IRLS in order to add prior information on the support of the sparse domain. Our simulation results show that the use of prior knowledge about positions of at least some of the nonzero coefﬁcients in the sparse domain leads to a reduction in the number of linear measurements required for unambiguous reconstruction. This reduction occurs for all values of , so that a further reduction can be achieved by decreasing and using prior information. The proposed weighting scheme also reduces the computational complexity with respect to the IRLS with no prior information, both in terms of number of iterations and computation time.},

A set of ﬁltered versions of the image is reconstructed using the available k-space samples, and a ﬁnal reconstruction stage generates the desired image from the ﬁltered versions. Our experiments, conducted over real MR images and angiograms, show that the proposed method improves the reconstruction over the total-variation minimization, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and computation time. The proposed method is particularly appropriate for computing MR angiograms, which are typically sparse under the ﬁnite-differences operation.},

	abstract = {What has happened in machine learning lately, and what does it mean for the future of medical image analysis? Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around 2009 when so-called deep artiﬁcial neural networks began outperforming other established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast expanding ﬁeld we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but put particular focus on deep learning in MRI.},

	abstract = {Undersampled magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction is typically an ill-posed linear inverse task. The time and resource intensive computations require trade offs between accuracy and speed. In addition, state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS) analytics are not cognizant of the image diagnostic quality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CS framework that uses generative adversarial networks (GAN) to model the (low-dimensional) manifold of high-quality MR images. Leveraging a mixture of least-squares (LS) GANs and pixel-wise 1/ 2 cost, a deep residual network with skip connections is trained as the generator that learns to remove the aliasing artifacts by projecting onto the image manifold. The LSGAN learns the texture details, while the 1/ 2 cost suppresses high-frequency noise. A discriminator network, which is a multilayer convolutional neural network (CNN), plays the role of a perceptual cost that is then jointly trained based on high quality MR images to score the quality of retrieved images. In the operational phase, an initial aliased estimate (e.g., simply obtained by zero-ﬁlling) is propagated into the trained generator to output the desired reconstruction. This demands very low computational overhead. Extensive evaluations are performed on a large contrast-enhanced MR dataset of pediatric patients. Images rated by expert radiologists corroborate that GANCS retrieves higher quality images with improved ﬁne texture details compared with conventional Wavelet-based and dictionary-learning based CS schemes as well as with deeplearning based schemes using pixel-wise training. In addition, it offers reconstruction times of under a few milliseconds, which is two orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art CS-MRI schemes.},

	abstract = {In recent years, a variety of segmentation methods have been proposed for automatic delineation of the fetal and neonatal brain MRI. These methods aim to deﬁne regions of interest of diﬀerent granularity: brain, tissue types or more localised structures. Diﬀerent methodologies have been applied for this segmentation task and can be classiﬁed into unsupervised, parametric, classiﬁcation, atlas fusion and deformable models. Brain atlases are commonly utilised as training data in the segmentation process. Challenges relating to the image acquisition, the rapid brain development as well as the limited availability of imaging data however hinder this segmentation task. In this paper, we review methods adopted for the perinatal brain and categorise them according to the target population, structures segmented and methodology. We outline diﬀerent methods proposed in the literature and discuss their major contributions. Diﬀerent approaches for the evaluation of the segmentation accuracy and benchmarks used for the segmentation quality are presented. We conclude this review with a discussion on shortcomings in the perinatal domain and possible future directions.},

At the same time, inverse and ill-posed problems began to be studied and applied systematically in physics, geophysics, medicine, astronomy, and all other areas of knowledge where mathematical methods are used. The reason is that solutions to inverse problems describe important properties of media under study, such as density and velocity of wave propagation, elasticity parameters, conductivity, dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability, and properties and location of inhomogeneities in inaccessible areas, etc.},
